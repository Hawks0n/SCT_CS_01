# SCT_CS_01
Caesar Cipher Encryptor/Decryptor (Tkinter GUI) A beginner-friendly Python GUI app that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. Built with Tkinter, it features a clean interface, real-time encryption/decryption, and basic input validation. Great for learning cryptography and GUI development.
 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryptor/Decryptor (Python GUI)

A simple yet powerful **Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool** built using **Python (Tkinter GUI)**.  
This app allows you to **encrypt or decrypt any message** by shifting letters based on a numeric key — one of the oldest classical cryptographic techniques ever created 

 🧩 Features
-  "Encrypt and Decrypt Texts" using Caesar Cipher logic  
-  Input your own **shift value (0–25) for flexibility  
-  Built with "Tkinter" for a clean, lightweight GUI  
-  Handles invalid inputs (non-numeric shift values) gracefully  

🖥️ How It Works
The "Caesar Cipher" replaces each letter in the plaintext with another letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example:  Plaintext: HELLO
Shift: 3
Encrypted: KHOOR

To decrypt, you simply shift backward by the same value.

  Installation & Run
 1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/caesar-cipher-gui.git
cd caesar-cipher-gui

2️ Run the program:
python3 caesar_cipher_gui.py
No external dependencies required — only built-in tkinter.
